            <h1>Background</h1>
            <p>My educational background was in Civil Engineering where I received my bachelors degree from West Virginia University and I also attempted a masters degree in Civil, however, I was not able to complete it due to personal reasons. 

My professional experience, however, has been in commercial real estate investments where I worked for Thelius Capital creating financial models to underwrite potential real estate deals. I started off as an analyst and later was promoted to Associate where I was given more responsibilities with acquisitions and training junior analysts. In addition to my day to day I had the opportunity to develop internal software for Thelius using Ruby on Rails. One of the projects i developed was the companies file sharing system called the "War Room", which we used to share documents with institutional investors, aka bank. As a result of developing this system, it helped us close a $100MM refinance for a client. I also developed our internal applicant tracking system.

After three years, I realized that I wanted to pursue a career in software development so in January, I left Thelius to attend Fullstack Academy to further improve my programming skills. During the program, I developed 3 projects where I worked as a sole developer and others where I worked on a team. I recently graduated from Fullstack, now i am looking for a role where I can work with talented developers and add value to a company like 2U.</p>
